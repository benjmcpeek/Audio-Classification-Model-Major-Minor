**Background** 

Audio signals are comprised of three main element:
- Amplitude: Is the distance between the highest and lowest points of a wave. The greater the distance of the two points refers to the volume of an audio signal. The image below shows the difference between louder and softer audio signals.

- Frequency: Is the amount of waves over a period of time. The more waves in a given period of time, the higher the frequency (pitch). The image below shows the difference between higher and lower frequencies.
